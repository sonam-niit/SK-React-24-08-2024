Redux ToolKit
----------------
Helping you to manage the global state by using some set of tools and abstractions which actually streaming your regular redux.

1. configureStore:

	new method which is used to create store and setup redux dev tools and all other extensions as well.

2. createSlice():

	Its a key functions which allows you to define state, reducers and actions at one place.
It generates actions automatically based on your written reducers.

3. Auto-generated actions:

	Redux Tool kit generated actions automatically when you write methods inside your reducers.

4. createAsyncThunk:	

	this function handles asynchronous logic (fetching data from API)

Steps which we have to follow:

1. Define a slice
2. configure a store
3. register store in main file
4. dispatch actions (useDispatch)
5. subscribe data in component when the state change (useSelector)
